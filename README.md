# data-struc-alg-II-class-project
My final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms II Class.

# The Prompt
In summary, this project aimed to optimize the delivery of a number of packages with specific delivery instructions.
The goal was to deliver the packages in under 140 miles, optimizing distance as able while still meeting delivery constraints.
Included here are a map of the delivery area, the table of distances between addresses, and a table of package/delivery constraints.

# My Solution
I created a hash table of packages and package details. I implemented a nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a type of greedy algorithm, to deliver my packages.
